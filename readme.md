# Music Theory Modules

This is a collection of tools for creating musical elements with typescript. Currently, only a sandbox, with the eventual goal to become an npm package. 

## How to play in the sandbox

### Requirements

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Start up

Everything runs from `index.ts`. Running `yarn start` will clean and build the app, then run `build/index.js`. To see any output, use `console.log()`.

```
$ git clone [this repo]
$ cd music-theory-modules
$ music-theory-modules > yarn (or npm install)
$ music-theory-modules > yarn start (or npm run start)
```
